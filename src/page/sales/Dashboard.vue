          <p>This Universal NDA (“uNDA”) is designed to standardize NDAs across companies in order to eliminate the time spent reading and negotiating NDA’s for routine commercial transactions. By open-sourcing this uNDA, we hope that this will become standardized and implemented for all routine commercial transactions locally, and ultimately nation-wide.</p>
