# Can you all see my screen?
  * GREAT
  * I'd like to walk you through a quick demo
      - to show some of the ideas we are exploring at Ozeki
      - WILL TAKE ABOUT 5 or 6 MINUTES
  * There's actually 3 quick demos
      - to demonstrate the cross team collaboration required to reach an agreement
  * Our lawyer works in our legal team
      - and sets the legal strategy by creating a playbook
  * Our business person works in our sales team
      - and initiates and negotiates sales agreements with customers
  * And of course our customer
      - who want's to purchase our products
  * So I'm going to show you 3 quick stories
      - to walk through a simple NDA agreement

# Starting with Lisa, our Legal team expert
  * Lisa is brought in early to set the legal strategy
  * She does this by creating a strategic playbook...
  * CLICK
  * To create our NDA playbook, Lisa will work with our AI assistant
      - here on the left
  * ... to answer some questions to customize and set strategy around our NDA template
      - here in the right

# THE FIRST QUESTION
  * our AI assistant asks is about the BUSINESS PURPOSE for the NDA
  * Ozeki can provide a generic business purpose
    - for example "a business opportunity of mutual interest and benefit"
  * so let's accept the generic description
  * You'll see that this decision is now added as a strategy in our playbook
  * Let's also allow for a more specific business purpose
    - YES
    - SELLING WIDGETS
  * Again, you'll see this decision has also been added to our playbook
  * NOW TO SAVE TIME our AI assistant is going to skip over some clauses...
    - CONTINUE

# AND ASK US ABOUT THE TERM OF AN NDA
  * here our lawyer can restrict which terms our business will allow
  * Let's allow a term of 1, 2, or 3 years
    - 1 TO 3 YEARS
  * Again, strategy now added to our playbook
  * This will come into play when our sales person generates a real NDA contract

# LETS SKIP AHEAD AGAIN
  * CONTINUE
  * and we're done with our playbook. We have a contract template
     - with various strategic rules added
     - around key terms
     - in natural language

# LETS SWITCH NOW TO OUR SALES PERSON
  * when a new lead is available
  * our sales person will generate an NDA for that customer
  * CLICK
  * A similar UX is presented
    - allowing our AI assistant to ask Sam questions
    - to fill in the blanks for this PARTICULAR agreement
  * YES to todays date
  * YES to default company name and address
  * Let's enter PIXAR INC as our counterparty
  * and CA as their incorporation state
  * and Park Place as their address 
  * here we see the choices that were defined by the legal team in the playbook
  * CHOOSE generic
  * LETS SKIP AHEAD
  * again, our choices are limited to those defined by the legal team in the playbook
  * CHOOSE 3
  * SKIP AHEAD AGAIN
  * and we're done with our contract.
  * this will now be sent out AS A PROPOSAL to our customer

# FINALLY, LETS SWITCH TO OUR CUSTOMER
  * who see's our proposed contract
  * and is asked to accept or reject our proposal
  * YES to accept preamble
  * YES to accept purpose
  * YES to accept terms
  * and we're done and will be asked to sign

# ALTERNATIVELY, LETS TRY THAT AGAIN
  * but this time we'll accept the preamble
  * but REJECT the purpose
  * and REJECT the term
  * and you'll see our reasons will be sent back to the sales team for negotiation

# THATS WHERE OUR DEMO ENDS TODAY
  * Lisa from our legal team set the strategy in the NDA playbook
  * Sam from our sales team uses that strategy when generating a new contract
  * Colin our customer can accept or reject each clause
    - which may or may not trigger a round of negotiation
    - where our more advanced negotiation features will come into play
